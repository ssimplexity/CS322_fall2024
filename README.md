- Office hour with the TAs: Wednesday 17-18h, Office 3409 at E3-1
  

  
- Schedule: 
  - Lecture Schedule. Monday and Wednesday, 10:30-11:45.
  - All lectures will take place on-site except for the week of 9-13 September and on 7th October.
  - The midterm exam will take place in the week of 28 Oct-1 November, one week after the offical midterm exam period.
  - The final exam will take place during the usual final exam period. 
     
- Grading: Homeworks, Participation, Quiz 30%, Midterm exam 35%, Final exam 35%
  
 
- Others:
  - The official language in the class is English. 
  - Homework assignments will be announced on the webpage. Expect an assignment at least every two weeks. Ideally, the solutions to homeworks should be written either in latex / in a text editor, e.g. MS Word / or VERY CLEAN AND IMMEDIATELY READABLE handwriting. People who grade your homework will NOT spend time struggling to decifer your handwriting. No matter how great your solution is, if it's not readable EASILY, it gets exactly that much score. The assignment needs to be submitted before the indicated deadline on [KLMS](https://klms.kaist.ac.kr/course/view.php?id=162187). 
  - A strict policy against dishonest behaviors will be applied; expect an "F" grade and be reported to the SoC board when you fail to follow the [honor code](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/content?menu=309).


Course Description
-------------------
We study ‘computer science’ and a computer is a computing machine. In this course, we study various notions and ideas which were developed since 1930’s in response to fundamental questions such as the following. 
  - What do we mean by computing? 
  - What is the object that a computing machine computes? Why we call a programming language a ‘language’?
- Both computer scientists and linguists talk about ‘languages’. Are there something in common? How to formalize the link between them.
- Computers ranging from high-performance server, desktop, laptops to mobile phones, from a wide range of manufacturers are all ‘computers’. On which ground, do we treate them as if they are (essentially) equally powerful machines which are all called computers?
- Is there a problem which cannot be ‘computed’? How to tell if a problem is computable or not.
- Is there a problem we’d better give up finding an ‘efficient’ algorithm? How to tell if a problem is efficiently computable or not.
  
- Is the computer implemented as your iMac the only form of a computer? 

Recommended Prerequisite: We assume that you have attended Discrete Mathematics (CS204) or have a sufficient background knowledge covered in similar courses. Introduction to Algorithms (CS300) is a plus. 
To be successful in this course, you need certain, if not high, level of mathematical maturity. For example, competence in writing a formal proof and digesting abstract concepts in mathematical formalism are needed. 
We also assume that you have a moderate experience in programming, even though we do not do coding during the class.
